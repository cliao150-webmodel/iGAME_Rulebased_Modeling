# iGAME_Rulebased_Modeling

This project aims to build kinetic models from preset rules and user-input files. The preset rules are template reactions used to instantiate biochemical reactions
that can potentially happen in cells. Given the model, we also automated the downstream analysis such as parameter search and numerical simulations. Our project won the "Best Software Tool" in the 2010 International Geneticall Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition (http://2010.igem.org/Team:USTC_Software). The original codes were written in C++ and here rewritten in Perl.
